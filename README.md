### TheKingsConsole is a small console application written in C# that analyzes data about monarchs. 

### The application fetches data from a JSON file and performs various analytical operations such as:
1.	Number of Monarchs: Displays the total number of monarchs.
2.	Longest Reigning Monarch: Finds and displays the monarch who reigned the longest.
3.	Longest Reigning House: Finds and displays the royal house that reigned the longest.
4.	Most Common First Name: Finds and displays the most common first name among the monarchs.

### The application is divided into two main parts:

•	Program.cs: The entry point of the application, which initializes the service and calls the appropriate methods.

•	MonarchService.cs: A service class that contains the business logic for processing and analyzing monarch data.

The data is stored in the sample.json file located in the Data folder.
